# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Read **[CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md)** at the start of every session — it is the single source of truth for this workspace (architecture, agent behavior, keyword triggers, runbooks, coding guidelines).

Quick reminders (details are in CONTEXT.md):
- **Never modify files in `human-read-only/`** — work only in `work/`
- **Follow runbooks in `runbooks/`** when triggered by keywords
- **Check REPOS.md** for clone URLs and branch conventions
- **Clickable PR links:** `[PR #N](url)` — never bare URLs
- **Commit and push meta code** (anything outside `work/`) in the root repo

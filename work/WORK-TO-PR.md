# Work directories → PRs

Maps each run directory under `work/` to its open/merged PRs for **trunk-style repos**. See [runbooks/general-fix.md](../runbooks/general-fix.md) for the rename convention.

| Run directory | Repo clone(s) | PR(s) | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|-------|--------|

**Convention:** When you open a PR for a trunk-style repo, rename that clone dir to `<repo>-<pr#>` (e.g. `backend-142`). Update this file when adding or removing run dirs.
